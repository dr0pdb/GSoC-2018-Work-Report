## Project Description
![Open Event](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6386234d12db1b6710ddaadc83cafd94b7a16299/68747470733a2f2f73746f726167652e676f6f676c65617069732e636f6d2f6576656e747961792e636f6d2f6173736574732f6272616e64696e672f626173655f6272616e64696e672e706e67)

The  **[Open Event](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event)**  Project offers event managers a platform to organize all kinds of events including concerts, conferences, summits and regular meetups. The various components support organizers in all stages from event planning to publishing, marketing and ticket sales. Automated web and mobile apps help attendees to get information easily.

There were two major divisions of this project:
1. Implementation of numerous features on the **Open Event Server** in order to make it feature complete. Some of the features that we aimed for were the integration of *payment system*, *tickets*, *taxes*, *promo codes* etc. 

2. Integration of missing endpoints and related features on the **Open Event Frontend** and **Open Event Orga** app. Some of the features that we aimed for in the *frontend* were the implementation of *promo codes*, *notifications* while *tracks* and *speakers* endpoints were targeted for the orga app.

## Results

Considering that we were able to achieve the project goals as well as implement additional features as our stretch goals, the project was a success.
